# FIXME


Danger Will Robinson: All of the README markdown files on this project kinda suck and need a thorough reworking - but for the week of time that this might take.

Look [here](./doc/TOC.md) for the documentation on this project

If you see FIXME anywhere in this repo, a developer hasn't finished the setup yet, after cloning `egg-starter`!
