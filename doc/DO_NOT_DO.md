# Just In Case You Missed Team Training:

- do not bring in bootstrap or jsx or LESS or SASS or any other legacy stack that has been replaced by current evergreen browser standards
- do not commit without using the `npm run commit` command
- do not do anything that messes up our near perfect lighthouse scores, unless there is some serious consensus established that you are actually improving the UX by making that one specific Lighthouse score drop
- do not put any state changes or event code in WC's when rdx would work well enough
-
