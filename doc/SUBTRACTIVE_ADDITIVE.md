# What is Subtractive vs Additive?

All systems try to do too much, or too little, or some combination of each.

Examples:

- Angular seems to try to do too much, and ties you in knots in the process
- Other systems are extremely compact and allow you do anything, any way you want to

Each approach has many advantages. Most of the exploration below is directed towards software systems that are learned and consumed by incoming noobies.

## Subtractive advantages

This app takes the starter approach of being subtractive.

- has most of what you need
- establishes an easiest way to do anything, consistently
- assumes you will subtract or remove stuff that isn't needed
- assumes you will add stuff back in but the system itself is already established
- everything always works
- student spends time on "wait a minute, why does this work?"

## Additive advantages

- best for learning the exact raw sequence or distilled essence
- especially good for forcing the "oh, by the way" like setting up dependencies that are not documented
- much slower for the impatient learner
- much faster for the teacher in a hurry
- student spends time on "wait a minute, why doesn't this work?"
- much more thorough for the dev really trying to get this down perfectly
