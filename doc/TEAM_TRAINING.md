# Expectations:

- you know how to develop js apps, to some degree
- you come with baggage - defined as things that must be unlearned (stone tools)
- you come with deficiencies - defined as things that you haven't yet learned (css grid, css variables)
- everybody on the team wants to develop in a very consistent way, as opposed to best way
- nobody is going to be perfectly happy, nor is that in the intentions
- you are _**dedicated**_ to making UX speed your top priority

## Sequenced Filters: What trumps what?

Each of these filters below is both heretical and counter-productive on many potential levels, especially at the edges.

Thus, the idea isn't to pass some kind of singular logic gate. The game is to arrange the filters so that the most important ones matter most, and some pass less perfectly than others in order that they can all pass with a high enough score to exit cleanly.

If you're a singular logic gate kind of guy, (For example "DX is all that matters") this is going to drive you crazy. Go ahead then, be crazy. The filters come first.

- browser standard trumps better legacy
- UX trumps DX
- maintainable trumps elegant
- consistency trumps better
- compact trumps not compact
- lighthouse scores matter more than almost anything but UX
- UX trumps lighthouse
- well supported by google/OWC/polymer trumps better by less reliable
- already on firebase trumps possibly better cheaper by [other]
- reactive trumps DX
- just about anything trumps DX if you have to think about it too much
- WC trumps otherwise better
- redux trumps otherwise better
- ubiquity trumps otherwise better
- tribal loyalties don't trump anything
- legacy skillsets don't trump much of anything
- learning/teaching works much faster from working examples to subtract from than adding snippets to non-working
- something here about how state of art leaves horrifying wrong instructions in legacy conversations
- always working same way trumps freedom to use what I want and get it working

## For when it's too much to sequence logic filters:

"More than two objectives is no objectives at all" Mark Shepard

Some of the above is just too eye-rolling to consider. So how to figure out which ones are worth paying attention to?

- stone tools are not my first choice
- slow is bad
- stupid is bad
